### Common FAQ
- **Does encrypt the files that are converted to the encoded video?**
  Not at all; files are plainly converted into video following the data density rules stated in the options. Nothing is encoded beyond that.
- **Requires installation?**
  No. The executable is completely standalone and that's why its so relatively big.

### File Security Check
File **is 100% safe**. You can check the following hashes below. Despite this some minor AntiVirus software may flag it as some kind of threat possibly because the software is not signed and some dependency triggering something.

Same issue can be easily found even with empty programs arround the internet as you can see [here (Stack Overflow exposing same issue)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60340213/what-could-be-causing-virustotal-to-flag-an-empty-program-as-a-trojan "here (Stack Overflow exposing same issue)").

For transparency purposes here you have the hashes for both the *.zip* and directly the executable below.
